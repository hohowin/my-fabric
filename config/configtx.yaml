#   CAPABILITIES
#
#   This section defines the capabilities of fabric network. This is a new
#   concept as of v1.1.0 and should not be utilized in mixed networks with
#   v1.0.x peers and orderers.  Capabilities define features which must be
#   present in a fabric binary for that binary to safely participate in the
#   fabric network.  For instance, if a new MSP type is added, newer binaries
#   might recognize and validate the signatures from this type, while older
#   binaries without this support would be unable to validate those
#   transactions.  This could lead to different versions of the fabric binaries
#   having different world states.  Instead, defining a capability for a channel
#   informs those binaries without this capability that they must cease
#   processing transactions until they have been upgraded.  For v1.0.x if any
#   capabilities are defined (including a map with all capabilities turned off)
#   then the v1.0.x peer will deliberately crash.

   # Orderer Type: The orderer implementation to start.
   # Available types are "solo", "kafka" and "etcdraft".
   OrdererType: etcdraft

   # Addresses used to be the list of orderer addresses that clients and peers
   # could connect to.  However, this does not allow clients to associate orderer
   # addresses and orderer organizations which can be useful for things such
   # as TLS validation.  The preferred way to specify orderer addresses is now

   # Batch Timeout: The amount of time to wait before creating a batch.
   BatchTimeout: 2s

   # Batch Size: Controls the number of messages batched into a block.
   # The orderer views messages opaquely, but typically, messages may
   # be considered to be Fabric transactions.  The 'batch' is the group
   # of messages in the 'data' field of the block.  Blocks will be a few kb
   # larger than the batch size, when signatures, hashes, and other metadata
   # is applied.
   BatchSize:

      # Max Message Count: The maximum number of messages to permit in a
      # batch.  No block will contain more than this number of messages.
      MaxMessageCount: 500

      # Absolute Max Bytes: The absolute maximum number of bytes allowed for
      # the serialized messages in a batch. The maximum block size is this value
      # plus the size of the associated metadata (usually a few KB depending
      # upon the size of the signing identities). Any transaction larger than
      # this value will be rejected by ordering. If the "kafka" OrdererType is
      # selected, set 'message.max.bytes' and 'replica.fetch.max.bytes' on
      # the Kafka brokers to a value that is larger than this one.
      AbsoluteMaxBytes: 99 MB

      # Preferred Max Bytes: The preferred maximum number of bytes allowed
      # for the serialized messages in a batch. Roughly, this field may be considered
      # the best effort maximum size of a batch. A batch will fill with messages
      # until this size is reached (or the max message count, or batch timeout is
      # exceeded).  If adding a new message to the batch would cause the batch to
      # exceed the preferred max bytes, then the current batch is closed and written
      # to a block, and a new batch containing the new message is created.  If a
      # message larger than the preferred max bytes is received, then its batch
      # will contain only that message.  Because messages may be larger than
      # preferred max bytes (up to AbsoluteMaxBytes), some batches may exceed
      # the preferred max bytes, but will always contain exactly one transaction.
      PreferredMaxBytes: 2 MB

   # Max Channels is the maximum number of channels to allow on the ordering
   # network. When set to 0, this implies no maximum number of channels.
   MaxChannels: 10

   # EtcdRaft defines configuration which must be set when the "etcdraft"
   # orderertype is chosen.
   EtcdRaft:
      # The set of Raft replicas for this network. For the etcd/raft-based
      # implementation, we expect every replica to also be an OSN. Therefore,
